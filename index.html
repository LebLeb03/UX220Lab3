       <p style="text-indent: 30px;: center">"Secondhand Lions" is a heartwarming and adventurous coming-of-age film directed by Tim McCanlies, released in 2003. The movie revolves around the story of a young boy named Walter (Walt), played by Haley Joel Osment, who is sent to live with his two eccentric great-uncles, Hub and Garth McCann, portrayed by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall, respectively. This unexpected journey transforms Walter's life and teaches him valuable lessons about family, bravery, and the power of imagination.

        The story begins with Walter's neglectful mother, Mae, played by Kyra Sedgwick, leaving him at the doorstep of his great-uncles' rural Texas farmhouse. Walter has never met his great-uncles before and only knows them through rumors and legends. Hub and Garth, however, live a reclusive life filled with stories of their past adventures, rumored treasure hunts, and encounters with exotic beasts. They are often seen sitting on the porch, cleaning their firearms, and enjoying life's simple pleasures.
        
        Initially, Walter feels out of place in this strange and rustic environment. He is curious about the tales of his great-uncles' past, especially the stories of their incredible adventures in Africa. As he gradually gets to know Hub and Garth better, Walter becomes captivated by their enigmatic past and the idea of hidden treasure on their property.
        
        As Walter spends more time with his great-uncles, he begins to see the world through their eyes. They teach him valuable life lessons about courage, honor, and the importance of standing up for what is right. The two elderly men also encourage Walter to embrace his imagination and creativity, which had been stifled by his mother's overprotective nature.
        
        The film takes a delightful turn as Walter uncovers the truth behind his great-uncles' stories, which leads to a series of adventurous escapades. He learns that the treasure they sought was not material wealth but the experiences and memories they collected throughout their remarkable lives.
        
        "Secondhand Lions" is a heartwarming tale of intergenerational bonding and personal growth. It explores themes of family, friendship, and the enduring power of storytelling. The movie reminds viewers of the importance of taking risks, facing fears, and living life to the fullest, regardless of one's age.
        
        In the end, Walter's time with Hub and Garth McCann proves to be transformative, as he emerges from the story a stronger, more confident young man. The film leaves audiences with a message that the greatest treasures in life are often found in the company of those who love and support us, and in the memories created along the way. "Secondhand Lions" is a delightful cinematic experience that celebrates the wisdom, courage, and imagination of its characters, making it a timeless and heartwarming story for audiences of all ages.? </p>

       <h3>
           Who's My favourite Character
       </h3>
       <p>
           My favourite Character is Hobb, who, although he has Ptsd. He has this grit and humanistic value he offers to the plot and story of the movie. Hobb connected with me as a character for not only being the perfect role model as an uncle who cares for Walt but also showcasing the rawness of his character does not naturally give.

       <h4>
           Who is in the wrong
       </h4>
       <p>
           This question can be answered fairly easily. The story paints the mom as the bad guy, but I also argue Walt is partly to blame for most of the issues developed in the movie. All in all, the movie is truly a classic and I always make the movie a suggestion for movie night with the family.
